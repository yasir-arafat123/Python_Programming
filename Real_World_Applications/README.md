## Philosophy
Python_Core focuses on the **language itself**: syntax, semantics, standard library, language features, and Python-specific concepts.
Real_World_Applications focuses on **using Python to build things**: frameworks, libraries, architectural patterns, and domain-specific applications.
The boundary: if it requires third-party libraries for its primary purpose (not just examples), or if it's about building applications rather than learning the language, it belongs here.
