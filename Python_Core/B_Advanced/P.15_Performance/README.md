## Learning Outcomes
- Benchmark without lying to yourself.
- Read and act on cProfile & tracemalloc reports.
- Distinguish algorithmic fix vs micro-optimization.
- Apply caching appropriately with invalidation strategy.

## Exercises
- Optimize a naive Fibonacci through three techniques.
- Measure memory growth of list vs array vs numpy.
- Add lru_cache and analyze hit/miss ratios.
