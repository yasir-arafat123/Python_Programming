## Key points

- Common issues: binary wheels vs source builds, missing compilers, dependency conflicts.
- Use `-v`/`-vvv` for verbose logs and `--no-build-isolation` when diagnosing build backends.
- Network issues: index mirrors, proxies, and SSL problems.

## Notes

Add step-by-step debugging checklists.
