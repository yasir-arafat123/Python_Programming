# Installing pip & Upgrades

## Key points

- Installing pip with system Python, vs bundled installers.
- Upgrading pip safely: `python -m pip install -U pip`.
- Use of `--user` vs virtual environments for system safety.
- Distinguish OS package manager pip from Python pip.

## Notes

Add platform-specific caveats and recommended commands for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
