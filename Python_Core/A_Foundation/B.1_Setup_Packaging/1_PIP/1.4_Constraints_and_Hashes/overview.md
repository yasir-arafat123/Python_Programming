# Constraints & Hashes

## Key points

- `--constraint` files vs `requirements` files; when to use each.
- Hash-checking mode (`--require-hashes`) for supply-chain security.
- Generating hash-locked requirements and the maintenance trade-offs.

## Notes

Add examples showing how to pin transitive dependencies with constraints and hashes.
