# Requirements.txt Workflows

## Key points

- `requirements.txt` formats: pinned (`==`), ranged (`>=,<`), and comments.
- Using `pip-tools` (`pip-compile`) for deterministic builds.
- Best practices for app vs library requirements.

## Notes

Add guidance for maintaining a separate `requirements-dev.txt` and pinned lock files.
