# Advanced Python Features
Focus: Advanced language features that go beyond everyday coding - decorators, metaclasses, descriptors, introspection, and advanced functional programming tools.
## Subtopics
1. 02_functools_caching_lru_cache_partial - Advanced functional utilities
2. 04_Descriptors - Attribute access control (advanced)
## Note on Module Consolidation
Many topics previously in K.10_Advanced have been moved to their specialized modules:
- **Concurrency topics** ??? O.14_Concurrency
- **Performance topics** ??? P.15_Performance  
- **Internals topics** ??? Q.16_Internals
- **Generator expressions** ??? G.6_Collections
- **Environment config** ??? T.19_Deployment
This module now focuses on truly advanced Python language features that don't fit elsewhere.
## Core Advanced Topics Covered Elsewhere
- **Decorators** ??? F.5_Functions
- **Context Managers** ??? F.5_Functions
- **Generators** ??? G.6_Collections
- **Metaclasses** ??? H.7_OOP
- **Type System** ??? L.11_Typing_Static
## Learning Outcomes
- Master functools utilities (lru_cache, partial, singledispatch, wraps)
- Implement custom descriptors for attribute control
- Understand when advanced features are appropriate vs overengineering
## Exercises
- Implement a validation descriptor
- Create a custom cache decorator using functools
- Compare descriptor vs property vs attribute
